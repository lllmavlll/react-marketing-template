# React template
This is a template for creating React applications with a modern folder structure, pre-installed packages, and commonly used components. It serves as a blueprint to kickstart your React projects with ease and consistency. The template includes configurations for Tailwind CSS, Context API, Redux, routing, and a collection of reusable components like Header, Footer, Button, and Card.

## Features

- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Context API**: Manage and share state across the application without prop drilling.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Reusable Components**: Pre-built components like Header, Footer, Button, and Card to speed up development.
- **Modern Folder Structure**: Organized layout for scalability and maintainability.
